## Project Introduction

### Overview
This project aims to utilize YFinance to fetch stock data and build a model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) to achieve high accuracy.

### Description
In this project, we leverage the power of YFinance, a Python library, to retrieve stock data from various sources. YFinance provides a convenient and efficient way to access historical and real-time stock data, including price, volume, dividends, and more.

The core of this project lies in the implementation of LSTM and GRU models. These are popular types of recurrent neural networks that are well-suited for time series analysis and prediction tasks. By training these models on the stock data acquired through YFinance, we aim to create a robust and accurate forecasting system.

The LSTM and GRU models are designed to capture the long-term dependencies and patterns present in the stock data, allowing us to make reliable predictions. These models have proven to be effective in a wide range of sequence prediction tasks, and we expect them to yield impressive accuracy in forecasting stock prices.

By combining the data retrieval capabilities of YFinance with the predictive power of LSTM and GRU models, this project aims to provide investors and traders with valuable insights and accurate predictions for informed decision-making.

### Benefits
- Efficient retrieval of stock data using YFinance
- Utilization of LSTM and GRU models for accurate stock price prediction
- Identification of long-term dependencies and patterns in stock data
- Improved decision-making for investors and traders

This project serves as a powerful tool for anyone interested in analyzing and predicting stock market trends, ultimately helping them make informed investment decisions.
